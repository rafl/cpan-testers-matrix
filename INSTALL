You need to make cgi-bin/cpantestermatrix.pl available as a CGI script.


One very easy way of doing that is using the included cpan-testers-matrix.psgi
file that wraps up the CGI script in a PSGI application. Just point `plackup' or
your favourite PSGI-supporting webserver at it, e.g.:

  $ plackup cpan-testers-matrix.psgi
  HTTP::Server::PSGI: Accepting connections at http://0:5000/


Note that you might need to change the #!shebang in cgi-bin/cpantestermatrix.pl
if you want to run it with a perl other than /usr/bin/perl.


With apache + mod_perl you can use the nearly "zero conf"
configuration file etc/httpd.conf:

* Just include the configuration file for use into your Apache, e.g.
  on a FreeBSD system:

    cd /usr/local/etc/apache22/Includes
    ln -s /path/to/cpan-testers-matrix/etc/httpd.conf cpan-testers-matrix.conf

  Or on a Debian system:

    cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
    ln -s /path/to/cpan-testers-matrix/etc/httpd.conf cpan-testers-matrix.conf

* NameVirtualHost should be turned on in the standard Apache
  configuration, if not already done, e.g. add into the standard
  httpd.conf:

    NameVirtualHost *:80

* Add an entry with the hostname "matrix-cpantesters" to your local
  DNS, or, easier, to your /etc/hosts:

    127.0.0.1     matrix-cpantesters

* Restart the Apache, and point your browser to http://matrix-cpantesters
